## Associating Hieroglyphs with Letters

In order to represent English letters and sounds with hieroglyphs, we need to make an `Association`. An `Association` is a lot like a dictionary or a set of rules.   

```
practiceAssociation = <|"Mark" -> "English", "Rachel" -> "Science", "Aisha" -> "History", "Omar" -> "Art"|>
```

In this example, the students: Mark, Rachel, Aisha, and Omar, are the `Keys`, and their favourite subjects: English, Science, History and Art, are the `Values`. Each `Key` has a `Value`, and you can look up the `Value` for a specific `Key`. In this example, evaluating `practiceAssociation["Rachel"]` gives the subject "Science".

So let's make an `Association` for letters (the `Keys`) to hieroglyphs (the `Values`). Hieroglyphs represent sounds, so they're not exactly matched to English letters, but they're still fun to experiment with.

Build an `Association` with the hieroglyphs. Give the `Association` the variable name `egypt`.

An `Association` starts with `<|` and ends with `|>`. Keys are associated with Values using `->`, and separated with a `,`. Go back to the `practiceassociation` at the start of this step if you need an example.

Here are the images for the hieroglyphs, in alphabetical order from A to Z. Copy and paste them one at a time into your notebook, building the `Association` one `Value` to `Key` combination at a time.
